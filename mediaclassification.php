		<p>Media categories</p>
		<p>How do we define organising categories for digital multimedia aimed at supporting education and the digital resource needs of creative people? While working on the design of the Panmultimedia website, two separate lines of investigation guided our choice of digital multimedia content categories. </p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>First, after looking around at what other multimedia providers were doing, we realised it was important to think about Panmultimedia.com in terms of the goods and services it provided as well as its broader contribution to the world-wide-web<i>.</i> For example, there seemed little point in attempting to include digital multimedia content on space exploration when the NASA website already has a breath-taking multimedia collection available in this area. The same could be said for the multimedia libraries associated with the National Geographic, NOAA, UNEP, Economist and Smithsonian Museum websites to name <i>but a few.</i> We felt it was important to actively acknowledge the wonderful contributions being made by other digital multimedia providers and to become an Internet traffic manager directing users to these amazing resources. Thus, because Panmultimedia.com is one small node in a far larger global information network, we needed to be clear about the value we could add to what others were already doing. In answer to this question, we could see that while there are breath-taking multimedia resources available on the Internet, contributions around how to coordinate these resources in computer-based approaches to education appeared to be largely missing.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Second, while space travel, science and technology, humanitarian aid, environmental advocacy and geographic exploration are all noble endeavours, it seemed that representation of an equally urgent priority was missing in all of these multimedia collections. We refer here to the problem of how to coordinate social, economic, cultural, scientific, artistic, governance and ecological activities in a way that maintains the wellbeing of the Earth system and its constituent parts (including human beings). There currently exists a need for multimedia resources in the thematically broad areas of complexity science in which our global community aspires towards the goals of social fairness, ecological sustainability and cultural survival. There exists a need for digital multimedia that represents these areas of human endeavour because while we have made the most amazing achievements in the arts, economics, science and discovery, we are still struggling to solve the most basic human-nature survival and wellbeing problem. </p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>It was these two lines of thought that influenced our selection of digital multimedia resources for the Panmultimedia website and guided our policies to actively support the efforts of other Internet multimedia providers. Thus, on the Panmultimedia website you will find a thematically broad range of resources and links to more thematically specific holdings in other parts of the Internet. In time, we also hope to add a section to this website that provides creative ideas, instruction and exemplars that show how multimedia resources can be used in teaching and learning contexts.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>With these initial goals in mind we have chosen to focus multimedia content attention on the most basic human-nature (i.e. ecological economic) relationship and divided this problem up into 10 areas of study and investigation. We have placed all ecological wellbeing learning content into one planet ‘Earth’ category with sub-categories focusing on relevant areas of disciplinary specialisation. We have placed all human wellbeing learning content into 9 categories including: economics, sacred, social, cultural, governance, education, science, gardens and arts. These 10 categories (outlined below) provide an initial starting point for thinking about ecological wellbeing and human happiness in a holistic frame of reference. With this broad content base, Panmultimedia.com provides digital multimedia resources that can be used in a wide range on educational, research, policy, publishing and film making applications.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Ecological wellbeing</h1></p>
		<p>Earth – <i>planet earth is our home and source of everything we need to survive (water, food, shelter, a home etc.)</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p><h1>Human wellbeing</h1></p>
		<p>Economics –<i> ensures our physical survival and makes it possible for us to contribute towards the wellbeing of others through useful employment.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Sacred – <i>some parts of our lives and experiences are sacred. Sacredness adds an essential dimension to our happiness and wellbeing.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Social – <i>our personal happiness is intimately associated with the relationships we build and maintain with family, friends and the members of our community.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Culture – <i>the way we see the world, the language we use to describe what we see and the nature of the environment we live in are distinguishing characteristics of our culture. The wellbeing of our culture is an important part of our personal happiness.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Governance – <i>our happiness is related to the faithfulness of those whom our communities elect to manage and protect our country, its regions and/or states.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Education – <i>learning is living. Education is physical, mental, spiritual and social development. An education qualifies us to contribute towards our community through employment.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Science –<i> contributes towards our happiness and wellbeing through the discovery of new knowledge, solving of complex problems and technological innovations that make our lives more enjoyable.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Gardens – <i>the Earth is actually one big garden with very impressive water features (i.e. lakes, rivers, waterfalls and oceans). The creation and maintenance of gardens that supply food for us to eat and beauty for us to admire contribute to our happiness and wellbeing.</i></p>
		<p><i></i><br></p>
		<p>Art –<i> communicates our perceptions of the world. We obtain joy and pleasure in creating works of art that others can admire and also enjoy. Art is an important influence on the design and creation of human living spaces.</i></p>
