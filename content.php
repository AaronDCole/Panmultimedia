		<p><h1>The Panmultimedia library</h1></p>
		<p>Because we have been capturing and storing digital content for approximately twenty years, our multimedia library contains digital media captured on equipment spanning a wide range of different technological eras. While the quality of some of this earlier media is variable, the information that it contains is of educational and historical value. By contrast, our current digital media is now being captured using state-of-the-art digital photographic, video and sound recording equipment.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Digital multimedia content on the Panmultimedia website has been organised into 5 categories: digital photographs, digital video, digital photographic clipart and digital sound and digital art. These 4 categories are described below.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Digital photographs</h1></p>
		<p>The digital photography library currently includes photographs taken between 1994 and 2012 from a range of countries around the world. These photographs are organised into 10 general topic areas - arts, cultural, Earth, economics, education, gardens, governance, sacred, science and social.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Classifying the photographs into categories presented an interesting challenge. We have devised a hierarchical system of classification that makes it possible to <i>browse</i> from general to specific topic areas. This is the easiest way to search for what you are looking for. In addition to this it is possible to <i>word search</i> the photographic metadata and photograph names using the site search engine. The interface for this search facility is located on the home page and browser windows. Photographic metadata used in word searching photographs includes: country, year and keyword categories.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>All digital photographs are provided in jpeg file format. Earlier photographs (1994-2006) are provided in original file size, which is typically around 1-3 megabytes. Photographs covering the years 2006 to the present have been compressed so that they are approximately half their original file size. In this format, these photographs are freely available under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 New Zealand licence. These photographs are ideal for desktop publishing purposes, webpages, Powerpoint presentations, sharing via email, video editing, illustration, Photoshop and audio-visual applications. Copies of original photographs for the years 2006 to the present are available for sale under the terms and conditions of a commercial licence.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Digital video</h1></p>
		<p>The digital video library currently includes video footage taken between 1994 and 2010 from a range of countries around the world. The same system of browse categories used to classify the photographic library have also been used for the video library. Categories for which there is currently no video footage have been omitted. Digital video content has not been encoded with metadata. It is possible to word search video content using video file names only. For this reason, browsing the video library is currently the most effective way of finding what you are looking for by using the auto play feature of this website. There are currently 10 <i>general</i> video browse categories - arts, cultural, Earth, economics, education, gardens, governance, sacred, science and social.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Digital video content from 1994-2010 was originally captured on film and has been digitised so as to make it available online. Digitised video files have been compressed and saved in standard 4:3 aspect ratio using Quicktime .m4v and .mp4 codecs. In this file format the video footage is suitable for use in video editing and desktop publishing applications and made available for such creative use under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 New Zealand licence. Copies of original, uncompressed (digitized) video files are available for sale under the terms and conditions of a commercial licence.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Photographic clipart</h1></p>
		<p>Photographic clipart is a new addition to our multimedia library. Photographic clipart is manually processed using image-processing software called ‘Pixelmator’. All photographic clipart is sourced from full size digital photographs taken in natural and studio settings. Photographs that have been manually keyed and cropped using Pixelmator software are saved without compression in .png file format so as to maintain transparent, background layers in the image. Given this process, all photographic clipart is of a high resolution and therefore able to be dramatically scaled.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>All photographic clipart is freely available under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 New Zealand licence. Photographic clipart is ideal for desktop publishing purposes, webpages, Powerpoint presentations, email, storyboard construction, video editing, illustration, and audio-visual applications. Copies of original, uncompressed photographs from which the clipart has been keyed and cropped are available for sale under the terms and conditions of a commercial licence.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Audio recordings</h1></p>
		<p>As of the time of launching the Panmultimedia website in February 2013, audio recordings are still being gathered and processed. This final media content section of our website is due to be released later in 2013. It is our aim to make backing music, sound reinforcement, and special effects sounds available for potential use in a wide range of digital creativity contexts.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Teaching and learning</h1></p>
		<p>Our decision to begin the creation of the Panmultimedia website by providing quick access to educational digital multimedia is a response to a perceived need. In home-education and busy classroom contexts, teachers rarely have spare time to spend searching for and/or creating good quality resources to enrich classroom teaching and student project work. We think that there is much that could be taught in educational lines, as well as much that could be written and created if educators, students, writers, reporters and researchers had access to safe, good quality, online digital multimedia resources. </p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>While our mission is to create computer-based, online teaching and learning technologies, we believe that digital multimedia of the kind available on this website is an invaluable teaching and learning resource. In time, we intend to provide an instructional and exemplar section to this website to inspire educators and students with creative ideas. In the meantime, here are some simple suggestions that we think will to help get you started.</p>
		<p><h1>Browsing</h1> – Panmultimedia digital resources capture aspects of real world environments and as such are knowledge rich. There is much that can be learnt from using these resources to visually browse related topic areas of interest.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Story telling</h1> – narrative is a tool that has been used for many centuries to create synthesis from perceptions and experiences of the real world. Panmultimedia digital resources can be used as inspiration for creating narratives and portraying the same in audio-visual form (i.e. video, presentations, creative writing etc).</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Teaching</h1> – a picture says a thousands words. The communication of ideas and in particular abstract concepts is greatly assisted with the aid of visual and audio resources. Panmultimedia digital resources can be used to create teaching resources that assist in visually integrating across varied topic areas.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Research</h1> - Panmultimedia digital resources can be used as a basis for creating inferences and deductions about learning environments and the relationships between parts. Theory building of this kind can be assisted with the use of integrative software platforms like Curio, Hyperstudio and PowerPoint that make it possible to create visual synthesis that includes explicit and detailed descriptions of interrelationships. </p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Communication</h1> - Panmultimedia digital resources can be used to create and/or enhance existing multimedia used as communication aids when: teaching, sharing research, story telling, writing creatively and reporting. The potential for conceptual and visual synthesis in the development of tools of this kind is limited only by creativity and imagination.</p>
