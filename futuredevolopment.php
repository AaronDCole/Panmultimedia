		<p><h1>In development</h1></p>
		<p>Further development of the Panmultimedia website is planned for 2013. Panmultimedia.com is the first stage of what will eventually be a network of websites that support practitioners and students working across a range of computer based, online teaching and learning areas. To date, the Panmultimedia website contains photographic, video, clipart and illustration libraries. In 2013 the following developments are planned.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>35mm slide collection</h1></p>
		<p>In 2013 we aim to complete the processing of our legacy, 35mm photograph collection. This will involve digitising 35mm slide collections. One of these slide collections comes from our former business entity ‘Nature on Film’ and includes a natural history collection of photographs from around New Zealand, parts of Europe and England. The second set of slides, were gifted to our legacy collection by a New Zealand ex-serviceman who was involved in active duty in Malaysia and Thailand during the early 1960s. This collection provides a fascinating visual and historical insight into the life of armed forces personnel at this time.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Photographic clipart</h1></p>
		<p>In 2013 our current photographic clipart collection will be enlarged. The current focus of our studio photography work is in the area of photographic clipart for children. By the end of 2013 we aim to have a visually engaging photographic clipart collection that can be used by children in storyboard creations, creative writing and project work. To support the narrative-based use of photographic clipart we are aiming to create photograph landscapes and backdrops that can be used as the basis of storyboard creations. Finally, we are slowly making our way back through our legacy and contemporary photographic collection cropping and keying out photographic clipart elements. By the end of 2013 our photographic clipart library should be greatly enhanced.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Video library</h1></p>
		<p>There are currently gaps in our video library collection that need to be filled and further development work in this area is planned for 2013. First, we have a large collection of legacy film footage from our former business entity ‘Nature on Film’ that we are slowing making our way back through. Second, there are some topic areas for which we need to gather new film footage. Finally, we are currently experimenting with the development of techniques for producing keyed video footage (i.e. special effects). Video resources from these three areas of development should become available during 2013.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Sound library</h1></p>
		<p>The development of the first resources for our sound library is also planned for 2013. What we have planned in the creation of sound resources that can be used to enhance multimedia creations, in particular video content. This will include the development of custom musical backing, sound effects and sound reinforcement resources. </p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Art</h1></p>
		<p>There is currently a small collection of artwork for children available on the Panmultimedia website and we have plans to develop this during the 2013 year across our general thematic areas: art forms, cultural, Earth, economics, education, gardens, governance, sacred, science and social. The holistic learning needs of young children are our main priority at present in this media area.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p><h1>Exemplars</h1></p>
		<p>While our first priority in the development of this website has been in providing holistic digital multimedia resources, we recognise that there is also a need for the creation of exemplars that provide inspirational ideas and practical guidance on how these resources can be used in teaching and learning contexts. During 2013 we will be working to create and provide exemplars across a range of teaching and learning areas. These will be located in the ‘education’ tab section of this website. </p>
